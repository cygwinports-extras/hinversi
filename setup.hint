ldesc: "Hinversi is a implementation of Reversi (a.k.a. Othello), a
board game in the style of Go. It can support many frontends and
backends, so you can select how clever your computer opponent is, and
whether you like to play using the console or a GUI. You can also let
one AI engine play against another one."
